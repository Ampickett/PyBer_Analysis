# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to show data between different city types, drivers, and riders. 

## Analysis
From the data, we can derive many conclusions. The biggest conclusion is that Rural cities have the least amount of drivers, riders, and total fares. Suburban cities have the 2nd most amount of drivers, riders, and total fares. Lastly, Urban areas have the highest density of drivers, riders, and total fares.

One interesting thing to note with Rural cities, is that although they have the least riders and drivers, they average the highest fares per ride. This would imply that Rurual areas are charging more for some reason. Perhaps to make up for the lack of volume or because of greater distances.
On the contrary, Urban drivers have the lowest average fare per ride. This would imply that due to the influx of drivers, the average fare rates remain lower.

## Summary
Please see below for our recommondations based on the data:
1. Incentivize riders in Rural areas to want to use the platform. The cost is much higher than in any other city type, so the cost of the fare will need to come down if you want to reach a wider audience.
2. Raise your prices in Urban areas. We recommond this because you have the highest amount of riders and drivers, you could raise the average cost of the fare to make up for the first recommondation.
3. Incentivize drivers to want to take on Rural and Suburban areas. Perhaps create a contest or pay-per-ride, to try and get your reach into all three city types. Drivers will need to be incentivized to take on areas that are less profitable/desireable.
